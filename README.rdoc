= Harvest Service for .Net 
A .Net wrapper for Harvest API.

This project is intended to simplify using the Harvest API in your .Net project by 
* hiding the complexity of setting up the HTTP Web Requests and endpoints.
* seamlessly deal with Harvests' API throttle limit.
* and having acceptance test coverage.

This version currently covers all "Project" service requests and "client" service requests, other requests maybe added in the future but you can extend IHarvestService.cs and IHarvestService.cs to handle more of the API.

In addition in the source code there's also a POCO project that uses this project that is very easy to extend if you don't want to deal with any XML.

== Source Code Prerequisites

This solution expects the following to be installed:
- Visual Studio 2010
- SpecFlow[http://specflow.org]

== Using the HarvestApi.dll

* Compile the HarvestApi into a DLL
* Add a reference to the DLL in your project
* Create an instance of the service and call the API methods
	
  var connectionInfo = new HarvestApi.Service.HarvestConnection("https://YOUR_SUB_DOMAIN.harvestapp.com","Your@Email.com","YourPassword");
  var service = new HarvestApi.Service.HarvestService(connectionInfo);
  string xml = service.GetProjects();

== Running the tests

The acceptance tests use SpecFlow with MSTest so that they can be run within Visual Studio.  You will need to setup your credentials in the HarvestApiSpec/App.Config

=== Setup Harvest Credentials 

Edit HarvestApiSpec/App.Config and update the XXXX placeholders with your Harvest account information.

  <appSettings>
    <add key="HarvestUri" value="https://XXXX.harvestapp.com/"/>
    <add key="Username" value="XXXX@XXXX.XXXX"/>
    <add key="Password" value="XXXX"/>
  </appSettings>

In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, Right Click HarvestApiSpec and select "Run Unit Tests"
